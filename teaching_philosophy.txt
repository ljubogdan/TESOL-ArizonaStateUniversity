My Teaching Philosophy, by Bogdan Ljubinković

Teaching purpose

I didn’t grow up dreaming of becoming an English teacher. In fact, whether I would end up teaching or not never seemed that important to me. But what always did matter was how things were taught. As a student, I spent years actively participating in competitions, winning awards, and pushing myself academically. Despite that, I often felt like I was on my own. Most of my teachers, while perhaps knowledgeable, lacked either the skill or the will to actually teach. Some treated their jobs like routines—just something to get through until payday. Year after year, I found myself being one of the few students fighting for better grades, relying more on my own persistence than on anyone’s guidance. These experiences shaped a quiet conviction in me: that one day, I could do better. I could become the kind of teacher I wish I had—one who sees the student not as a task, but as a potential waiting to be recognized, supported, and challenged.

In the short term, I want to help my students develop strong listening and reading comprehension skills in English—ideally to the point where they can understand 99% of what they hear or read. I believe this foundation is key for building real confidence and curiosity about the language. Long term, my goal is to help them become effective and independent communicators—capable of expressing themselves clearly in writing and in conversation. In my own learning journey, speaking and writing in English were always more difficult than passive skills, mostly because I had no one to practice with. That’s why I want to create a space where students feel safe to try, to make mistakes, and to grow. Because English is not just a subject—it’s a tool for opportunity. And I want to be one of those teachers who helps others unlock that tool and use it with pride.

Teaching style

My teaching style is rooted in the Communicative Approach, which encourages learners to actively use the language in realistic situations. I believe that students, especially young learners, benefit the most when they feel they are actually doing something with the language — asking, answering, describing, reacting. That is why I plan to use interactive activities, role play, simple conversations, and real-life contexts in which English is not just studied but experienced. I want students to use English to express their own ideas, not just repeat after me.

Alongside that, I connect deeply with the Affective-Humanistic and Comprehension Approaches. I think creating a positive and relaxed environment is essential, especially for children. I believe in motivation as the strongest teaching tool. I want to be the teacher who inspires students to want to learn, who makes them feel safe enough to take risks and make mistakes. My energy, persistence and emotional intelligence help me to connect with students and make learning joyful. Of course, I will complement this emotional connection with visual materials, music, games and movement — anything that makes learning come alive.

Since I will be working with elementary school children at the beginning of my teaching journey, my style will be flexible, energetic and adaptive. My focus will be on building their confidence, curiosity and a natural feel for the language. As I grow and develop professionally, I hope to teach adults as well, but no matter who I teach, my style will remain centered on connection, motivation and creating meaningful learning moments.

Teaching techniques

In my classroom, I plan to use a variety of techniques that work together to create a safe, motivating, and active learning environment. Since I’ll be working primarily with young learners, I believe that lowering the affective filter and using warm language are essential. I want every student to feel safe, seen, and encouraged. Whether a student makes a mistake or gives the perfect answer, my tone will remain kind and positive. I’ll use gestures, expressions, and repetition to reinforce understanding, along with teacher talk and language learning strategies that are age-appropriate and natural.

I believe in the 80/20 rule — students should spend most of the time practicing the language, not just listening to me. From my own experience, I know that attention drops quickly after 10–15 minutes of lecture. That’s why I’ll focus on active involvement through conversation, repetition, and games. I start each lesson with a friendly warm-up — asking how students are doing and creating a comfortable atmosphere before diving into content. For guided practice, I plan to work together with the class on tasks like reading aloud or simple dialogues. Independent practice will include activities like short quizzes, dictations, creative writing, or language games. These will allow students to explore language on their own, while I quietly observe and offer individual feedback.

I do not believe in grading every task. Formal assessment can often cause anxiety and take the joy out of learning. Instead, I will give my students practice tests and activities that feel like part of the lesson, not an evaluation. This way, they can build confidence, recognize progress, and develop intrinsic motivation to keep learning — without the fear of being judged.
